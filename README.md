Learning a programming language can be difficult if one only watches programming tutorials and practice problems.
The other way to learn a language is to make different projects which can help to upskill ourself and get a good grip on a programming language.
Some projects which i am doing in python as a beginner are:

1. Python Text-To-Speech (easy)
2. Python Weather Application (easy)
3. Image resizer (easy)
4. PDF Merger (easy)
5. Facial recognition system (medium)
6. And many more....
